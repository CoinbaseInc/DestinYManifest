3D MODEL
========

3D01 - correct number of breakers (fuses)
3D02 - fuselage around the panel is way too large. Compare the pictures below:

3D03 - map the nose cone to a texture in the file c172p-fuselage-skyhawk.png as to make creating liveries easier (the top right corner of this file is empty)
3D04 - currently the tail is mapped only to the top one in the file tail.png (that is, the left side). Therefore, what we see is the right side mirrorred, which causes problem if a livery has any text in that position.
3D05 - when moving the rudder, part of the fuselage moves as well (!)
3D06 - livery must be discuted. Maybe wing and tail in a single file with all sides (top, bottom, right and left).
  * Gilberto: why? And do you think you can fit wing (top and down), tail (left and right) and stabilizer (top and down) in a single file?!
3D07 - fix some face loops on the fuselage.
3D08 - retopology of the panels.
3D09 - Remodel the base giving it a better shape. (Is it lower than normal ?)
3D10 - Add reflex on the glass.
3D11 - can put "glass effect" over the gauges. What do you think ?
  * Gilberto: that would be great!!
3D12 - Always ZHI
3D13 - Don't forget to remove ZHI easter-egg when finish (until now, two cents at the baggage, one for gsagostinho and one to ludomotico).
3D14 - background can be seen through some little holes around the instruments, see: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/63093453/fg/c172p/seeth2.jpg

TEXTURES
========

TEX01 - better background for magneto keys
TEX02 - create both high resolution (2048x2048) and regular resolution (1024x1024) of darker panel and allow the user to switch among them (such as by using two different liveries, one called "OH-CTL (HD)" and the other simply "OH-CTL")
TEX03 - better texture for the ceiling

ANIMATIONS (XML)
================

XML01 - with the instrument illumination turned on, the heading indicator bug and the inactive square of the turn coordinator should be illuminated
XML02 - with the instrument illumination turned off, the heading indicator bug and the inactive square of the turn coordinator should be completely dark (will see, thevirtualfer)
XML03 - the background of the attitude indicator (just behind the moving part which shows the attitude) is currently grey, but it should be coloured according to the file AI1.rgb
  * Ludomotico: This is a weird bug: the background of the AI depends on the angle of view or the zoom level.
XML04 - when opening the door from the inside of the cockpit, the latcher is colliding with the door handle strip (maybe it is a 3D. Things are that way in a normal door ?)
XML05 - make flaps clickable in the cockpit?
XML06 - Add Throsten's new effect for glass
XML07 - Check all interior objects are NOT selected if the viewer is further than 50m (useful in multiplayer)
XML08 - fine tune ALS shadow to translate lower with aircraft on deck and translate higher on altitude gain
XML09 - Themes not working in Rembrandt
XML10 - Behind many instruments you can see the sky! For example, the turn coordinator. Transparent surfaces and wrong shaders?

PROCEDURES
==========

PRC01 - carb heat does not drop RPM as expected
PRC02- fine tune tyresmoke for better display at softer landing?
PRC03 - add dust effect during off-pavement landing and take-off.
PRC04 - crash detect/gear collapse - see Cap10C for example
PRC05 - make flaps clickable in the cockpit?
PRC06 - primer procedure with flooded engine: if the engine is flooded and turned off (lean mix, no throttle, mags off) and then on again, it automatically resets the situation and requires more primer, while in real life it would have a different procedure (it would stay flooded)
  * Ludomotico: I think an (initially) flooded engine will probably start if the starter runs long enough because the movement of the piston will extract the fuel from the cylinders. Beware I never tested this in real life and I'm not completely sure! In any case, I think giving a second chance to the pilot to start the engine by reseting the state of the primer is fair :) Which are the options? Calling thee engineer by reseting the simulator?
PRC07 - implement oil management and oil check
PRC08 - check failures

TUTORIALS
=========

TUT01 - Tutorials are currently not working. They crash the simulator
PRC02 - Add missions to the extended tutorial system

FDM
===

FDM01 - the default's c172p FDM is rated at only 3 stars. Any ideas on how to improve ths would be great!

OTHER BUGS
==========

BUG01 - interior not visible through the glasses from outside (but visible when the door is opened), see: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/63093453/fg/c172p/seeth1.jpg
BUG02 - REMBRANDT support, pleeeeeeeease.
BUG03 - mixture keys (m and shift-m, are not working. Reported by onox)
BUG04 - performance issues while on the ground, which disappear immediately as the wheels get in the air. I believe this started at around the same time as we tweaked the touchdown smoke files, so can someone check this?

OLD (ALREADY FIXED, TEST!)
=========================

XML11 - according to tigert, the compass has a fairly dim illumination, although some planes have it broken. Implement it or not?
  * Implemented
TEX04- implement the black and blue attitude indicator to our Cessna (located at ./Models/Interior/Panel/Instruments/AI). If someone doesn't like it black and blue, then create a brown and blue version of it. Any votes on this?
  * Implemented
XML12- smoke coming from tyres during takeoff (at around 40 knots)
  * Gilberto: I believe this was solved by
