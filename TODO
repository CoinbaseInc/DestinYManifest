3D MODEL
========

- correct number of breakers (fuses)
- when opening the door from the inside of the cockpit, the latcher is colliding with the door handle strip
- fuselage around the panel is way too large. Compare the pictures below:

- carb heat in the darker panel has a transparent circle around it. It is present on both light and dark panels, but it's easier to spot in the darker version; see: http://s18.postimg.org/43bzy54mh/fgfs_screen_001.png

TEXTURES
========

- better background for magneto keys
- create both high resolution (2048x2048) and regular resolution (1024x1024) of darker panel and allow the user to switch among them (such as by using two different liveries, one called "OH-CTL (HD)" and the other simply "OH-CTL")

INSTRUMENTS
===========

- according to tigert, the compass has a fairly dim illumination, although some planes have it broken. Implement it or not?
- with the instrument illumination turned on, the heading indicator bug and the inactive square of the turn coordinator should be illuminated
- with the instrument illumination turned off, the heading indicator bug and the inactive square of the turn coordinator should be completely dark
- implement the black and blue attitude indicator to our Cessna (located at ./Models/Interior/Panel/Instruments/AI). If someone doesn't like it black and blue, then create a brown and blue version of it. Any votes on this?
- the background of the attitude indicator (just behind the moving part which shows the attitude) is currently grey, but it should be coloured according to the file AI1.rgb

XML, PROCEDURES, VISUAL FX, ETC.
================================

- carb heat does not drop RPM as expected
- smoke coming from tyres during takeoff (at around 40 knots)
- make flaps clickable in the cockpit?
- primer procedure with flooded engine: if the engine is flooded and turned off (lean mix, no throttle, mags off) and then on again, it automatically resets the situation and requires more primer, while in real life it would have a different procedure (it would stay flooded)

FDM
===

- the default's c172p FDM is rated at only 3 stars. Any ideas on how to improve ths would be great!

OTHER BUGS
==========

- interior not visible through the glasses from outside (but visible when the door is opened)
