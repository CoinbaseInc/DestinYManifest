3D MODEL
========

3D01 - correct number of breakers (fuses)

3D02 - fuselage around the panel is way too large. Compare the pictures below:

3D05 - when moving the rudder, part of the fuselage moves as well. The back of the plane should be redesigned, the rudde should go all the way to the bottom, see: http://s3.postimg.org/oy7ao6x6b/image.png

3D06 - livery must be discuted. Maybe wing and tail in a single file with all sides (top, bottom, right and left).
  * Gilberto: why? And do you think you can fit wing (top and down), tail (left and right) and stabilizer (top and down) in a single file?!
  *fer: Why ?  : Because there is a waste of space in the tail file and in wing file.
        And you think... : Don't know, yet bro. Will see. 
  * Gilberto: ok, go for it, just careful not to lower too much the resolution (particularly of the tail since it usually has text, colours, etc)

3D07 - fix some face loops on the fuselage.

3D08 - retopology of the panels.

3D09 - Remodel the base giving it a better shape. (Is it lower than normal ?)

3D10 - Add reflex on the glass.

3D11 - can put "glass effect" over the gauges. What do you think ?
  * Gilberto: that would be great!!

3D12 - Always ZHI

3D13 - Don't forget to remove ZHI easter-egg when finish (until now, two cents at the baggage, one for gsagostinho and one to ludomotico).

3D14 - Organize the blender file. It was ok, in the first time i imported. Until i realize the livery problem pointed by ludomotico. Then i just reimported the original model and was muuuuuch more lazy than the first time.

3D15 - Doc the blender file and the caveats involved. Intents to give ludomotico freedom to change the model if i die flying (hehehe).

3D17 - Propeller blades and wing lights do not change their texture when changing liveries and themes.

3D18 - Fix color difference between spinner and fuselage (probably there is a difference in the parameters used in the materials of spinner and fuselage, fixable in Blender). See: http://s14.postimg.org/v79i8sj69/spinner_too_bright.png

TEXTURES
========

TEX02 - create both high resolution (2048x2048) and regular resolution (1024x1024) of darker panel and allow the user to switch among them (such as by using two different liveries, one called "OH-CTL (HD)" and the other simply "OH-CTL")

TEX03 - better texture for the ceiling
  * Gilberto: what do you mean by better? Right now it has the same texture as the walls. Do you want something different?

TEX04 - when new magneto keyhole texture is applied, create text (OFF, L, R, BOTH, START) in the background panels

TEX10 - texture for the cap of the ventube (top left and top right of the panel, as seen here: http://www.cruik.org/blog/ventubes/ventube-out.jpg)

TEX11 - when the project is finished, optimize all textures by creating an optimum palette (indexed colour)

TEX12 - search for unused textures and delete them
  * Gilberto: for instance, does our model use the files c172p-02.png, c172p-int-01.png, c172p-int-02.png and UV_cone.png? 
  
TEX13 - see what to do with the older liveries, since they will require some updates if we want to keep them (adding wing lights, propeller, etc. to each one of them)

ANIMATIONS (XML)
================

XML03 - the background of the attitude indicator (just behind the moving part which shows the attitude) is currently grey, but it should be coloured according to the file AI1.rgb
  * Ludomotico: This is a weird bug: the background of the AI depends on the angle of view or the zoom level.
  * Gilberto: I can swear this has already been fixed, or am I seeing things?

XML05 - make flaps clickable in the cockpit?

XML06 - Add Throsten's new effect for glass

XML07 - Check all interior objects are NOT selected if the viewer is further than 50m (useful in multiplayer)

XML08 - fine tune ALS shadow to translate lower with aircraft on deck and translate higher on altitude gain

XML11 - Radios are saving the volume state, but they are displaying information when starting at volume 0. If one turns the knob to another volume and back to 0, then the information disappears as expected.

XML12 - Regarding the master switch, the battery switch should be on the right side while the alternator should be on the left. Currently they are inverted.

XML13 - When hoovering the mouse above the battery switch, it displays the message MASTER. This should be changed to BAT, since a master switch is composed of both BAT and ALT (currently the alternator displays the message ALT which is correct)

XML14 - Instrument illumination is too strong during daytime. In the original c172p, one could hardly tell the difference between 0% and 100% instrument illumination during daytime. At nighttime, our project behave exactly as expected.

XML15 - if an alternator is turned off (such by a failure), the battery should slowly drain all its energy over a certain period of time (minimally 30 minutes, probably more for a good working battery), causing a complete electrical failure. In case it was not a failure and the alternator is turned on again, the battery should recharge back over time

XML16 - better modelling of Ammeter: it should read zero if battery fully recharged and alternator on, or show the positive flow of current from the alternator to the battery if the latter is not fully recharged, or show the negative flow of energy being drained from the battery if alternator fails or is turned off

XML17 - better modelling of Loadmeter: when both alternator and battery are switched on it reads ~33 V (almost an electric overload, I believe), which is already beyond the yellow range. Turning lights, radios and instrument on and off currently make no difference, but I believe it should raise the load of the system

PROCEDURES
==========

PRC01 - carb heat does not drop RPM as expected

PRC02- fine tune tyresmoke for better display at softer landing?

PRC03 - add dust effect during off-pavement landing and take-off.

PRC04 - crash detect/gear collapse - see Cap10C for example

PRC05 - make flaps clickable in the cockpit?

PRC06 - primer procedure with flooded engine: if the engine is flooded and turned off (lean mix, no throttle, mags off) and then on again, it automatically resets the situation and requires more primer, while in real life it would have a different procedure (it would stay flooded)
  * Ludomotico: I think an (initially) flooded engine will probably start if the starter runs long enough because the movement of the piston will extract the fuel from the cylinders. Beware I never tested this in real life and I'm not completely sure! In any case, I think giving a second chance to the pilot to start the engine by reseting the state of the primer is fair :) Which are the options? Calling thee engineer by reseting the simulator?
  * Gilberto: I believe the normal procedure to start a 172 with flooded engine is as follows: mixture fully lean, throttle fully opened, crank the start keys several times. As soon as the engine starts, mixture fully rich and throttle back to 1000-1200 RPM. I would say that at the moment the engine restarts is the moment where the excess fuel in the tank should be reset. Does this make sense?

PRC07 - implement oil management and oil check
  * Gilberto: related to this, we could implement "low oil pressure" failure and "low or high oil temperature" type of failure

PRC08 - check failures
  Gilberto: tested all failures individually (all instruments, all systems, engine, flaps, etc.) and they all seem to work perfectly as expected. Maybe someone else would like to double check this before marking it as solved, but I guess it's all well here. But see some suggestions concerning failures on items PRC07, PRC10, PRC11 and PRC12

PRC09 - correction to the checklist: it's common practise to have the beacon light ON before starting engine, not after (it helps to warn people around that you are about to start the plane)

PRC10 - model carb icing: in specific meteoroligical conditions where carburator icing would happen, it would cause the engine's RPM to drop, which may be followed by engine roughness and even complete engine failure. Currently I can't make the carburator develop ice.

PRC11 - electrical failure could be actually divided into two different types of failures: 1) electric overload and 2) alternator failure (see XML15)

PRC12 - model pitot icing

TUTORIALS
=========

TUT01 - Tutorials are currently not working. They crash the simulator

TUT02 - Add missions to the extended tutorial system

FDM
===

FDM01 - the default's c172p FDM is rated at only 3 stars. Any ideas on how to improve ths would be great!

OTHER BUGS
==========

BUG03 - mixture keys (m and shift-m, are not working. Reported by onox)

BUG04 - performance issues while on the ground, which disappear immediately as the wheels get in the air. I believe this started at around the same time as we tweaked the touchdown smoke files, so can someone check this?

OLD (ALREADY FIXED, TEST!)
=========================
XML11 - according to tigert, the compass has a fairly dim illumination, although some planes have it broken. Implement it or not?
  * Implemented

TEX04- implement the black and blue attitude indicator to our Cessna (located at ./Models/Interior/Panel/Instruments/AI). If someone doesn't like it black and blue, then create a brown and blue version of it. Any votes on this?
  * Implemented

XML12- smoke coming from tyres during takeoff (at around 40 knots)
  * Gilberto: I believe this was solved by wlbragg

XML10 - Behind many instruments you can see the sky! For example, the turn coordinator. Transparent surfaces and wrong shaders? See: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/63093453/fg/c172p/seeth2.jpg
        It is 3D14, below.

3D14 - background can be seen through some little holes around the instruments, see: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/63093453/fg/c172p/seeth2.jpg
  * Gilberto: same as XML10, and probably not a 3D problem, so erased from 3D list
       *fer: Gil. It appears to be a 3D problem. Maybe the last commits has solved it.
  * Gilberto: it's fixed

TEX01 - better background for magneto keys
  * done, can be found in COLOR_panel_parts.png

BUG02 - REMBRANDT support, pleeeeeeeease.
  * identical to XML09 ("Themes not working in Rembrandt"), thus removed but NOT FIXED

TEX05 - add glass texture (white, 20% alpha) to COLOR_interior.png
  * done

3D03 - map the nose cone to a texture in the file c172p-fuselage-skyhawk.png as to make creating liveries easier (the top right corner of this file is empty) 
       *fer: Map is on the default livery of the plane

XML02 - with the instrument illumination turned off, the heading indicator bug and the inactive square of the turn coordinator should be completely dark (will see, thevirtualfer)
        *fer: Fixed on the 3D model. I start to think what someone said in this thread. Why not copy all the instruments we use ? 

BUG01 - interior not visible through the glasses from outside (but visible when the door is opened), see: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/63093453/fg/c172p/seeth1.jpg
        *fer: added the ludomotico solution to ALL windows and add ALL windows to ALL livery block. Here, it is ok. But do your own test, please.

XML01 - with the instrument illumination turned on, the heading indicator bug and the inactive square of the turn coordinator should be illuminated
        *fer: Dug so much to find this simple solution.

XML04 - when opening the door from the inside of the cockpit, the latcher is colliding with the door handle strip (maybe it is a 3D. Things are that way in a normal door ?).
        *fer: Well. Changed the angle from 70 to 50. Looks better, but i don't know if it works this way.

TEX05 - glass textures should have 100% alpha, not 20%
  * done, in the interior textures of all 3 liveries (D-EEQA, red and blue)

TEX06 - import nose cone texture from ./Model/UV_cone.png to c172p-fuselage-skyhawk.png
  * done, in the fuselage textures of all 3 liveries (D-EEQA, red and blue). 
  * Gilberto: they are only a solid colour so far, but as soon as it is applied in the model I will make shadows and everything else

3D16 - After puting a black firewall to fix 3D14, the turn coordinator gauge disappeared. See: http://s16.postimg.org/6pw5adj2d/fgfs_screen_001.png
  * Gilberto: this is an invalid problem, as it turned out the turn coordinator was removed by ludomotico for inspection, nothing to do with the black firewall
  * Gilberto: turn coordinator added back by thevirtualfer

XML09 - Themes not working in Rembrandt
        *fer: BUG01 and XML09 are the same bug. Added full path on <texture> entry for livery. Both bugs are solved. Removed the glass livery and the rembrandt test.
        *fer: Well, maybe the bug was not solved. But i believe that it is now. You can't use tranparecies in texture files. Living and learning.

3D04 - currently the tail is mapped only to the top one in the file tail.png (that is, the left side). Therefore, what we see is the right side mirrorred, which causes problem if a livery has any text in that position.
  * Done
  
TEX07 - improve propeller spinner
  * after implementing TEX09, there was not much to improve in the spinner's texture, it's a solid colour now

TEX08 - put a solid background in all textures of dark-red and cream-blue themes
  * done
    
TEX09 - remove texture shadows from propeller spinners (related to TEX07)
  * done
